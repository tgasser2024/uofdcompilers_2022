On structures day, we learned that we can have a pointer to a structure.

A structure can even contain a pointer to the same type as itself, for example:

struct t_foo {
	int data;
	struct t_foo *next;
};

This kind of structure is known as a _linked list_, where each element points to an element of the same kind. We can then go from item to item in the list by using the "next" pointer.

For lab 4, implement a linked list as shown above. Dynamically allocate (that is to say, use malloc) a list of 100 items, each pointing to the next. Traverse that list in a for loop, printing some part of each element.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions. This is due on 10/18/2022.
