Lab three is a request to write an EXCELLENT encryption system, using the advanced "rot13" technique.

Your program should read in any text file specified on the command line, and then either encode or decode the file in question.

I've included a sample file for your edification.

You might invoke this to encode as `./a.out encode filename.txt`.

You might invoke this to decode as `./a.out decode filename.txt`.
