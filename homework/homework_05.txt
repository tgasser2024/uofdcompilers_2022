Create a makefile for the lexer built in class, that does all the things:

- creates a c file from the .l file
- compiles that c file
- runs a test
- cleanup
- build for submission

I should be able to type "make clean" then "make test" and see the output.

You can see the steps required by pausing the video as I built the program.
